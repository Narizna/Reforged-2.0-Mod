Armour was 11mm and main armament was the 20mm KwK35 L/45 ( later some used captured T-26 turrets) and the vehicle tipped the scale at over 12 tons.

Official designation was Leichter Panzerspähwagen Sdkfz.221 (Light Reconnaissance Armored Car -Special Purpose Vehicle 221). 340 were delivered from 1936 to 1939. This four-wheeled vehicle proved to be fast ( 80 km/h ) and agile, but it quickly became apparent it had limited off-road capabilities. In some cases, the original MG was swapped for an anti-tank rifle 39 or, later, a model 41 28 mm anti-tank gun, in order to increase its firepower.

The Sdkfz.231 had 15 mm of slightly sloped front armour. Production versions of the SdKfz.231 were fitted with a 155 HP, eight-cylinder Büssing-NAG L8V-G petrol engine, which gave a top speed of 85 km/h. From July 1942 they were built on the same Einheitsfahrgestell chassis and had their armour increased to 30 mm. Later a more powerful engine was installed, providing 180 PS instead of 155 PS. It had all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering and two driver positions at front and rear. The turret in the 231/232 series was a hexagonal shape and equipped with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and a coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun."
