All of the governing powers in Romania were at his hands, turning Romania from a democracy into an absolute monarchy."

With the violence of the elections, and the appointment of the Octavian Goga cabinet, the King saw no other option but to deliver the power that Codreanu desired to him by making him the leader of Romania, although Codreanu was at first reluctant to accept, he was then able to convince Carol to in fact hand him absolute and totalitarian powers over the state, effectively turning the formerly democratic country into a totalitarian dictatorship."

With the fall of France, the francophile elite of Romania had lost most of its influence and say almost overnight. Antonescu partly complied with the request but also asked Carol to bestow upon him the reserve powers for Romanian heads of state. Carol yielded and, on September 5, 1940, the general became Prime Minister, and Carol transferred most of his dictatorial powers to him. The latter's first measure was to curtail potential resistance within the Army by relieving Bucharest Garrison chief Gheorghe Argeșanu of his position and replacing him with Dumitru Coroamă."

They had been revived under the leadership of Horia Sima, and was organizing a coup d'état, now with Antonescu’s imprisonment the perfect opportunity had come as the general was full of resentment for the current government and wished to end the Royal Dictatorship that was bringing Romania to the brink of destruction. With his widespread influence and control over the Romanian army, especially the third army that was stationed in the eastern provinces, Antonescu’s soldier and the Iron Guard marched upon the capital, in an event that shall be known as the “March on Bucharest”. Soldiers who were meant to protect the capital from the “insurrection” as Carol had branded it, simply laid down their weapons or joined with the march. Carol managed to escape in the last moment on a train, whilst chased by elements of the Romanian army and the Iron Guard."

After the army was curtailed, Antonescu quickly replaced the other generals with his own loyalists and effectively took full control over the armed forces of Romania, putting him, effectively, in charge of the country. After being treated as a hero after avenging the death of the popular Codreanu, Antonescu placed himself in charge of the country as a Co-Conducator who was to guide the existing Iron Guard leadership."

So on one fateful night, Carol had Codreanu and 13 other Iron Guard leaders murdered, with the official story that they were “shot while trying to escape”. The killings saw much of the Iron Guard’s leadership wiped out, and it has gone down in history as “the night of the vampires”.  German newspapers showed their outrage by regularly running stories casting doubt about the official version of events that Codreanu had been “shot while trying to escape”, whilst the western democracies largely remained silent and uninterested in the affairs of Romania.

Stalin has made himself an icon, but at the cost of making many real enemies and innumerable imaginary ones.\n\nHaving seen the worst of internal power struggles, the General Secretary is prone to act on the slightest suspicion.

Meanwhile, the navy's frequent contact with foreigners has led to many of them being arrested as well.\n\nAlthough there are documents from our enemies proving their guilt, there is no telling if they fabricated them, or if they were given false information by those who wanted this purge in motion to begin with."

They waited in their cabin for the rest of the passengers to get on board, and once the ferry signalled its departure by blowing its horn the agents went into action and started stalking every conrer of the ship. Until they came upon a cabin which had been completely vacated in a hurry, they realized that the person in question was making a run for it. They quickly went to the upper deck to look for anyone who seemed to be in a hurry, and noticed that there was a gathering of people around where one of the life boats should've been.

This meant that the NKVD agents had both the time and the date when they would lay in wait for Trotsky. The NKVD agents took up position on a street in a worn down part of the city, trying to stay as hidden as possible. When they suddenly heard 4 men walking at a rapid pace towards them, as the NKVD agents revealed themselves and assaulted the pedestrians they were put in a direct confrontation with the local police who were on their way to raid the local communist party.

One of the agents tried to line up a perfect shot, whilst the other ran towards the reception area where people were still mingling and enjoying champagne, the once quiet and peaceful scene had turned into a commotion by the time the pursuit was over and as the agents had got out into the street of Rome, the four men were long gone, and so were the NKVD agents aspirations."

The discrepacy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."

Military High Command has publically declared that anyone who showed up at their duty station will not be charged with any crime or punished for failing to do so in the past. Still, a number of people have categorically refused to take up arms for their country and have been arrested."

At dawn, military police raided the homes of a number of carefully selected, well known and connected people who have used their influence to allow others to avoid the draft. Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military. Their families have mobilized their extensive support networks to protest this descision. The War Office has been flooded with calls and letters from simple workers who want their factory manager back to undersecretaries in various other ministeries, demanding to know why people working in fields critical to the war effort have been removed from their work.

He has gone so far as to accuse Roosevelt of corruption – that is, of acquiring so much power that he was subverting the Constitution: The President spoke truly when he boasted ... "We have built up new instruments of public power." He spoke truly when he said these instruments could provide "shackles for the liberties of the people ... and ... enslavement for the public". These powers were granted with the understanding that they were only temporary. But after the powers had been obtained, and after the emergency was clearly over, we were told that another emergency would be created if the power was given up. In other words, the concentration of power in the hands of the President was not a question of temporary emergency. It was a question of permanent national policy. In my opinion the emergency of 1933 was a mere excuse ... National economic planning—the term used by this Administration to describe its policy—violates the basic ideals of the American system ... The price of economic planning is the loss of economic freedom. And economic freedom and personal liberty go hand in hand."

The American economy took a sharp downturn in mid-1937, lasting for 13 months through most of 1938. Industrial production declined almost 30 percent, and production of durable goods fell even faster. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in May 1937 to 19.0% in June 1938.[1] Manufacturing output fell by 37% from the 1937 peak and was back to 1934 levels.[2] Producers reduced their expenditures on durable goods, and inventories declined, but personal income was only 15% lower than it had been at the peak in 1937. In most sectors, hourly earnings continued to rise throughout the recession, partly compensating for the reduction in the number of hours worked. As unemployment rose, consumer expenditures declined, leading to further cutbacks in production."

It was a significant factor in public and political support for American neutrality in the early stages of World War II.

 germany.129.t:0 "Reichskommissariat Norwegen"
 germany.129.d:0 "The need by National socialist Germany to occupy and incorporate Norway into a German empire came about for two principal reasons. The first was that in 1940, Germany was dependent on natural resources, mainly iron ore, being sent from Sweden to Germany. If Norway allowed Allied vessels to pass through its waters, they could potentially blockade the trade routes. The second reason was that Germany feared an allied attack, either using Norway as a staging area, or moving through Sweden.\nCollaborationist support came from the pro-National-socialist Nasjonal Samling ("National Gathering" or "National Unification") party led by Vidkun Quisling, who was allowed by Adolf Hitler to form a Norwegian government under German supervision. Quisling became Minister President of Norway in 1942 but lacked any real power. Reichskommissar Terboven held control over Norway as a governor, and all the military forces stationed in Norway were under German command."

The newly occupied Second Polish Republic was split into three zones: the General Government in its centre, Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany in the west, and Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union in the east. The administration of the General Government was composed entirely of German officials, with the intent that the area was to be colonized by Germanic settlers who would reduce the local Polish population to the level of serfs."

 germany.133.d:0 "At the time of the invasion of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler was uneasy with Mussolini's agenda of creating a puppet Croatian state, and preferred that areas outside of Italian territorial aims become part of Hungary as an autonomous territory. This would appease Nazi Germany's ally Hungary and its nationalist territorial claims. Germany's position on Croatia changed after its invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. The invasion was spearheaded by a strong German invasion force which was largely responsible for the capture of Yugoslavia. Military forces from other Axis powers, including Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria made few gains during the invasion. The invasion was precipitated by the need for German forces to reach Greece to save Italian forces, which were failing on the battlefield against the Greek armed forces. Upon rescuing Italian forces in Greece and having conquered Yugoslavia and Greece almost single-handedly, Hitler became frustrated with Mussolini and Italy's military incompetence. Germany improved relations with the Ustaše and supported the NDH claims to annex the Adriatic Coast in order reduce Italy's planned territorial gains. Nevertheless, Italy annexed a significant central portion of Dalmatia and various Adriatic Islands. This was not what had been agreed with Pavelić prior to the invasion; Italy had expected to annex all of Dalmatia as part of its irredentist claims."

A few agents of the NKVD moved always among them, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating any individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party. It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice. It was not necessary to know much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance."

A grand celebration is due to take place in the morning, and you shall surely be rewarded as a hero of the Soviet Union for dragging Russia’s antiquated industry into the 20th century.

You are summoned to Stalin’s office (effective immediately), and there the man sits comfortably in his chair, puffing away at his pipe, enormous plumes of smoke obscuring most of his face following your entrance through half-closed eyes. He gestures to the chair on the other side of his desk. Maybe this wasn’t as bad as you had feared.  Oh how very were you indeed. Stalin leaps to his feet and bends over the entire length of the desk until his face is no less than a foot away from yours. His eyes wide with a severely unwelcoming glower. You go to open your mouth, but no sooner have your lips even parted, Stalin tears you to shreds. Beginning with the typical accusations of being a traitor and an agent working against the Motherland, to outright tirades regarding how well you have been treated and why would you go against your home, your family, your leader.  Eventually Stalin manages to calm himself down and seats himself down to top up his pipe. His eyes return to a passive, half closed state as he focuses on the pipe bowl in front of him. After what feels like ages he finally announces that you will not punished too severely, but your family will be placed under very heavy scrutiny and should you fail again, well, you will find out. And with that he points the door, whereupon a guard opens it and ‘helps’ you out. "
