nor_gigachad_idea_desc:0 "Norway got invaded for several reasons. Regardless, unlike other Scandinavian countries that also got invaded, Norway put up an admirable defense that would slow the Germans down. Though, realistically they had no chance, they would slow down the German invaders. Resisting for around 2 months against the onslaught of the invaders. All while the heroic Norwegian Army was defending their homeland, their was a political war occuring. The Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold refused to abandon the position of neutrality, despite Germany's aggressive posturing. Upon German invasion, the King Haakon VII, The Norwegian Royal Family, and the Norwegian Parliment would board trains to Hamar to avoid capture and discuss the course of action. Collaborator Vikdun Quisling declared himself Prime Minister in their absence and called for cooperation with German Forces. After relocating to Elverum to escape approaching German forces. Haakon VII would meet with German Envoy Curt Bräuer, who advocated for Haakon and the rest of Norway to capitulate and cease resistance to the Germans. Haakon would relay this information to the government, and personally was unable to accept these demands as well as unable to accept Quisling as the new Prime Minister. He would offer to abdicate, however, if the Government felt this was the best course because Haakon was a firm believer in democracy. This would not be necessary, however, as the Cabinet would reject German demands. Haakon, his Son Crown Prince Olav, and the Cabinet of Norway would escape to the United Kingdom. Where they would remain as a Government in Exile till the end of the war."
